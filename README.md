# Code-Refactor-week-one

Refactoring code for a mock website using best practices

The goal is to focus on semantics, the webpage is not "responsive".

1. refactor code to use semantic HMTL, this inlcudes using the correct HTML element tags <nav>,<aside> etc.

2. using alt attributes on images.

3. deleting duplicate code and structuring class names to follow semantic rules.

Take away lessons:

1. start small.

2. look for patterns and repeate code to combine into classes to removed duplicate code.

3. BEM naming convention can avoid targeting or styling html elements when it is not neccessary.

4. commit small working changes.
